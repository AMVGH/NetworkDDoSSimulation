Explaining Validation Against Real World DDoS Patterns, Attack Approach, and Botnet Topology:

    As outlined in the initial proposal, a modified centralized C&C topology will be utilized in order to model 
the attacking network throughout the course of this malicious network traffic simulation. A centralized C&C topology 
is characterized by its use of a single C&C resource to communicate with all bot agents, where each bot agent is issued new 
instructions directly from the central C&C point. While we have not implemented a class to directly model this central C&C point, the botnet
is designed to capture this behavior by directly issuing the same instructions to the infected machines within its network.
    Furthermore, as outlined in the initial proposal, the botnet in this simulation will be sending requests at a fixed rate to the target
server, as opposed to exhibiting dynamic behavior in order to combat defensive network strategies. While this attack methodology may not be as 
robust as some other means of network attacks, it is still extremely relevant to the overall network system domain. In Cloudflare's DDoS
threat report for Q2 of 2025 they directly state, "Layer 3/Layer 4 (L3/4) DDoS attacks plunged 81% quarter-over-quarter to 3.2 million, 
while HTTP DDoS attacks rose 9% to 4.1 million. Year-over-year changes remain elevated. Overall attacks were 44% higher than 2024 Q2,
with HTTP DDoS attacks seeing the largest increase of 129% YoY." This illustrates that despite the "elementary" attack strategy that 
is a flat-rate HTTP flood, the prevalence of these attacks are growing year over year.
