**Network DDoS Simulation**

**Author:** Alex Valentin
**Course:** CS 4632 Section W01

**Project Overview**
The aim of this project is to analyze the impact of malicious network traffic on network systems. This area
of study is extremely relevant to the overall network system domain, especially considering the rise of DDoS
attacks against large enterprise services year-over-year. The results intend to explore how Distributed
Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) impact server response time and the ability to serve legitimate network traffic,
furthermore, how do safeguards such as load-balancing help reduce latency, improve throughput, and prevent
server deterioration when under attack. This project will simulate legitimate and malicious network traffic,
servers and server responses, and network performance degradation under load. Items outside the scope of this
project and thus will not be included in the final simulation include the implementation of End-to-End security
protocols (i.e.: TLS handshakes, firewalls, IDS/IPS).
